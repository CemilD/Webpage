    <!-- My storie -->
    <div class="text">
    <p>I am Cemil and have had a passion for programming since I was 16 years old.

        The time I spent as an aircraft mechanic master in work planning and data processing in aviation technology in the Bundeswehr (German Armed Forces) was a good and experiential period involving SAP and VBA programming in Excel.
        
        Later, as a sub-project manager in nuclear power plants in Belgium and France, I had the opportunity to apply project management methods and capture current processes.
        
        I combine my technical affinity with a joy for adapting customer needs into appropriate technical solutions using SAP and add-ons.</p>
